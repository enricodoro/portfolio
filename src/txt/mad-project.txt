During the master's degree course I partecipated with three other students in the development
of a carsharing mobile application for Android for the Mobile Application Development course.
The application was developed from scratch using Kotlin and Android Studio as IDE, following
the Material Design guidelines. At the end of the project (completed in about 3 months), we
released a quick presentation video.
