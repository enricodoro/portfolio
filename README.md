# Portfolio Web Page

This is the code for developing my own portfolio web page, using [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and the React UI library [Material UI](https://mui.com/).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, run these two scripts according to the situation:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run deploy`

Builds and publishes the page at [this address](https://enricodoro.github.io/portfolio) exploiting GitHub Pages.
