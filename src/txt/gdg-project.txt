During the same semester that I developed the carpooling application
I partecipated in the development of two other projects for two different courses.
In the first one, I collaborated with five other students in the creation of a
videogame from scratch, including every aspect of it: we produced a trailer, a playable prototype
and a pitch document as if we were to present it to a publisher to have it funded. We named it
"Cicles" and each one of us had his specific role in the group: personally I programmed 
most of the prototype using Unity and I was in charge of managing the sound effects.
