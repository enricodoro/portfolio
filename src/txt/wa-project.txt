The other project that I developed was for the Web Application course, and I developed it on
my own, using React Bootstrap, Javascript, JSX and Node. We had 20 days to develop a survey website,
with the possibility to login and create your own surveys and let other unregistered users to answer them
and storing all the answers in a database (using SQlite) so that can be retrieved and viewed by the
user that created that survey.
