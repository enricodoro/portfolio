My name is Enrico D'Oro, I was born in Ivrea (Italy) in 1996.
I'm currently enrolled in the Software course of the Polytechnic of Turin
where I formerly graduated as a Computer Engineer.
I like developing web and mobile applications, in particular working on interfaces design, 
in order to produce a useful and easy to use product.
